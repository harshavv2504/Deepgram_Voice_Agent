- **Input Filtering**: Protection against injection attacks

#### Infrastructure Security
- **Container Security**: Docker images with minimal attack surface
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security updates for dependencies
- **Environment Isolation**: Proper separation of development and production environments

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

#### For Developers
- **Code Review**: All code changes require security review
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scanning of dependencies
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
- **Secure Coding**: Following OWASP secure coding guidelines

#### For Deployment
- **Environment Variables**: Never commit secrets to version control
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege for system access
- **Network Segmentation**: Proper firewall and network configuration
- **Monitoring**: Security event logging and monitoring

#### For Users
- **API Key Security**: Keep Deepgram API keys secure and rotate regularly

- **Microphone Permissions**: Be aware of microphone access permissions
- **Data Handling**: Follow data protection regulations for voice data

## Known Security Considerations

### üîç Current Limitations

#### Voice Data Processing
- **Browser Audio**: Voice data is processed in the browser before transmission
- **WebSocket Transmission**: Audio data is transmitted over WebSocket connections
- **Temporary Storage**: Audio data may be temporarily stored during processing
- **Third-party APIs**: Voice data is sent to Deepgram for processing

#### Mock Data System
- **Development Data**: System uses mock customer data for demonstration
- **Data Persistence**: Mock data is stored in local JSON files
- **No Encryption**: Mock data files are not encrypted (not recommended for production)

#### Web Interface
- **Client-side Processing**: Some data processing occurs in the browser
- **Local Storage**: Browser may cache audio and conversation data
- **Cross-site Scripting**: Standard web application XSS considerations

### üöß Recommendations for Production Use

#### Data Security
- **Real Database**: Replace mock data system with encrypted database
- **Data Encryption**: Implement encryption at rest and in transit
- **Access Logging**: Comprehensive audit logging for all data access
- **Data Retention**: Implement proper data retention and deletion policies

#### Authentication
- **User Authentication**: Implement proper user authentication system
- **Role-based Access**: Add role-based access control for different user types
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Consider MFA for administrative access
- **Session Security**: Implement secure session management

#### Infrastructure
- **Load Balancing**: Implement proper load balancing for scalability
- **DDoS Protection**: Add DDoS protection and rate limiting
- **Security Headers**: Implement security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- **Regular Updates**: Establish process for regular security updates

## Compliance Considerations

### üìã Regulatory Compliance

#### Data Protection Regulations
- **GDPR**: European General Data Protection Regulation compliance
- **CCPA**: California Consumer Privacy Act considerations
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data protection (if applicable)
- **SOC 2**: Service Organization Control 2 compliance

#### Industry Standards
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management standards
- **NIST Framework**: Cybersecurity framework implementation
- **OWASP Top 10**: Web application security risks mitigation
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card industry standards (if applicable)

### üîê Privacy Considerations

#### Voice Data
- **Consent**: Obtain explicit consent for voice recording and processing
- **Purpose Limitation**: Use voice data only for stated purposes
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary voice data
- **Retention Limits**: Implement appropriate data retention periods

#### Customer Information
- **Data Classification**: Classify customer data by sensitivity level
- **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls for customer data
- **Anonymization**: Consider data anonymization for analytics
- **Right to Deletion**: Implement data deletion capabilities
